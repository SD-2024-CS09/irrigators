# Configuration Files
## comm_config

"comm_config.json" should be located in /etc/irrigator. It contains the IDs and API keys needed for the Matlab app to read/write to the ThingSpeak sensor and state channels. It also contains the delay for how often the Matlab app checks the water and bounds config files for updates.

## path_config

"path_config.json" should also be located in /etc/irrigator. It contains the paths to the folder containing the user's 'matlab.bin' and /src files.

# IPC Files
## sm_config

"sm_config.json" should be located in /var/lib/irrigator. It contains the last saved values for the upper and lower bounds of the state machine. sm_config can be written to by the webserver, and is watched for updates by the matlab app.

## watering

"watering.json" is used solely for aborting the state machine. It should remain empty unless written to by the webserver.
